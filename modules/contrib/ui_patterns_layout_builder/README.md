# UI Patterns Layout Builder

Use a pattern as a block.

## Overview:
Use a pattern from UI Patterns with Layout Builder.

Patterns from UI Patterns don't work out of the box with Layout Builder because Layout Builder does not recognize UI Pattern fields as regions.

This module makes a pattern compatible with Layout Builder.

## Installation / configuration:
Simply install and enable the module. Don't forget to enable ui_patterns_layout (If you don't use another layout discovery module.).

No more configuration is needed and every pattern can be used as a layout in the layout builder.

The development is still in very early stage.
